            For the uninitiated, web development is ridiculously confusing, and even frustrating at times. 
            As a man who was&mdash;<i>and constantly is</i>&mdash;in a position of learning, I have come across my fair share of struggles. 
            Moments where I felt like I was behind, reliant on AI and tutorials when everyone seemed to just... <i>get it</i>. <br>
            Web development has truly humbled me, even to the point of feeling like I would never catch up, that I would never understand something I had found so interesting for most of my life. <br><br>
        </p>
        <p>
            &lt;ADJ/Code&gt; was created to be a crash course, a survival guide, even, for the ins and outs of web design and development. 
            As a web dev, myself, I firmly believe that the greatest form of mastery is teaching. 
            So, having gone through the frustration of learning web development, I am taking it upon myself to make web development a little less frustrating thing to learn.
            If I am able to help even <strong class="emphasis">one</strong> person increase their understanding of web development principles, I would consider this website's creation a job well done, and time well spent.
